# opengl-glew

Bindings to OpenGL with GLEW extension loading.

Chicken's other [opengl](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/opengl) bindings are based on the old fixed function pipeline OpenGL. These bindings generated by [bind](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/bind) with the OpenGL [core header file](http://www.opengl.org/registry/api/GL/glcorearb.h). Additionally, bindings to [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) are provided for extension management.

The opengl-glew egg provides two modules, an eponymous module that provides the main OpenGl and GLEW functionality, and `gl-utils` which provides various high-level functions.

## Installation
This repository is a [Chicken Scheme](http://call-cc.org/) egg.

It is part of the [Chicken egg index](http://wiki.call-cc.org/chicken-projects/egg-index-4.html) and can be installed with `chicken-install opengl-glew`.

## Requirements
- make
- bind
- z3 (gl-utils)
- matchable (gl-utils)
- miscmacros (gl-utils)
- srfi-42 (gl-utils)

## Documentation
All functions and constants from the OpenGL [core header file](http://www.opengl.org/registry/api/GL/glcorearb.h) are exported. Scheme style names are provided (underscores and camelCase replaced with hyphens), the `gl` prefix is removed from names, functions starting with `is` instead end in question marks, and constants are bookended by `+`s (e.g. `delete-texture`, `enabled?`, `+arb-viewport-array+`). The terms `1D`, `2D` and `3D` are additionally hyphen separated in order to match their constant counterparts (e.g. `tex-image-2d` and `+texture-2d+`).

Functions whose C counterparts accept or return `GLboolean` accept or return a Scheme boolean value. *Do not* pass `+true+` or `+false+` to these functions.

### GLEW functions

    [procedure] (init)

Required to initialize GLEW/OpenGL. An OpenGL context must be created before this is called.

    [procedure] (supported? EXTENSION-NAME)

Query whether the OpenGL extension, given as a string, is supported.

### GL helper functions
The functions in this section are part of the opengl-glew module, rather than gl-utils because they either provide a direct interface to an OpenGL function in a more Scheme-like fashion, or they simplify fundamental operations that rarely must be performed differently.

    [procedure] (make-shader TYPE SOURCE)

Creates and compiles a shader object given the shader's type (e.g. `+vertex-shader+`, `+geometry-shader+`, `+fragment-shader`), and a string containing the GLSL source. Returns an integer representing the ID of the shader.

    [procedure] (make-program SHADER-LIST [PROGRAM-ID])

Creates and links a program object, given a list of shader objects (i.e. the integers returned by `make-shader`. Returns an integer representing the ID of the program.

Accepts an optional `PROGRAM-ID` argument. If given, `make-program` will use this ID rather than generating a new one.

    [procedure] (gen-buffer)
    [procedure] (gen-framebuffer)
    [procedure] (gen-program-pipeline)
    [procedure] (gen-query)
    [procedure] (gen-renderbuffer)
    [procedure] (gen-sampler)
    [procedure] (gen-texture)
    [procedure] (gen-transform-feedback)
    [procedure] (gen-vertex-array)

Analogous to their pluralized counterparts, but only generates and returns one (integer) object.

    [procedure] (delete-buffer BUFFER)
    [procedure] (delete-framebuffer FRAMEBUFFER)
    [procedure] (delete-program-pipeline PROGRAM-PIPELINE)
    [procedure] (delete-query QUERY)
    [procedure] (delete-renderbuffer RENDERBUFFER)
    [procedure] (delete-sampler SAMPLER)
    [procedure] (delete-texture TEXTURE)
    [procedure] (delete-transform-feedback TRANSFORM-FEEDBACK)
    [procedure] (delete-vertex-array VERTEX-ARRAY)

Analogous to their pluralized counterparts, but only accepts and deletes one (integer) object.

    [procedure] (check-error)

Performs `get-error` (`glGetError`) and prints the error type when an error is returned.

### gl-utils
gl-utils provides functions for creating VAOs, and loading PLY files.

    [procedure] (make-vao VERTEX-DATA INDEX-DATA ATTRIBUTES [USAGE])

`make-vao` generalizes the typically repetitious code used to initialize vertex attribute objects. It deals with the case of having packed vertex data (`VERTEX-DATA`) and a vector of indices (`INDEX-DATA`) for those vertexes. This data may be passed as any sort of (srfi-4) vector or a blob.

`ATTRIBUTES` is the list of data necessary for the vertex attributes, in the form of `((LOCATION TYPE N [normalize?: NORMALIZE?]) ...)`. `LOCATION` is the attribute location, `TYPE` is the type of data corresponding to the given attribute, given as a keyword. For possible types, see `type->gl-type`. `N` is the number of elements for the given attribute. The keyword `normalize?:` accepts a boolean argument which instructs OpenGL to normalize the attribute or not. Defaults to `#f`.

The optional `USAGE` must be one of `+stream-data+`, `+stream-read+`, `stream-copy`, `+static-data+`, `+static-read+`, `static-copy`, `+dynamic-data+`, `+dynamic-read+`, `dynamic-copy`. Defaults to `+static-draw+`.

`make-vao` returns the ID of a vertex array object. This object should be deleted with `delete-vertex-array` when no longer used. Intermediate vertex buffers are generated and deleted, thus only the returned vertex array ID needs to be managed.

    [procedure] (load-ply FILE BUFFER-SPEC)

Loads a [PLY](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ply/) file. `FILE` is a path that may be pointing to a gziped PLY file. `BUFFER-SPEC` is a list in the form `((NAME VARS) ...)` where `NAME` is the name of an element in the PLY file and `VARS` is either a list of property names or, in the case of a property list, a single name. Two values are returned: a list of u8vectors which correspond to the buffers named in `BUFFER-SPEC` and a list of the elements that are in the PLY file in the form of:

    (element-name n-elements (property-name property-type))

Or, when an element is a property list:

    (element-name n-elements (property-name (list: list-length-type element-type)))

The buffers returned are packed with the contents of the properties named in the `BUFFER-SPEC`. Thus, for a PLY file that has element `vertex` with properties `float x`, `float y`, `float z`, `float confidence`, `uchar r`, `uchar g`, and `uchar b`, as well as a nelement `face` with a property list `uchar ushort vertex_index`, the following `BUFFER-SPEC` could be used:

    (load-ply "example.ply.gz" '((vertex: (x y z r g b)) (face: vertex_index)))

This buffer spec would result in a list of two u8vectors being returned: one with the packed elements corresponding to properties `x`, `y`, `z`, `r`, `g`, and `b` (with the corresponding property types), and the second containing the vertex indices.

    [procedure] (load-ply-vao FILE vertex: VERTEX face: FACE)

Similar to `load-ply`, but returns a number of values:

- A vertex array ID as generated by `make-vao`. 
- A u8vector representing the vertex data of the model
- A u8vector representing the index data of the model
- The number of vertices of the model
- The GL enum value of the type of primitive used for the model (e.g. `+triangles+`)
- The GL enum value of the element data type 

`FILE` is a PLY file (which may be gziped). The PLY file must contain at least the elements `vertex` and `face` (other elements will be ignored). `VERTEX` is a list of `(attribute-location property-name ...)` elements, which specifies how the vertex buffers of the VAO will be arranged. All properties named by each element of `VERTEX` must be of the same type. `FACE` is the name of the face property list.

Again, for a PLY file that has element `vertex` with properties `float x`, `float y`, `float z`, `float confidence`, `uchar r`, `uchar g`, and `uchar b`, as well as a element `face` with a property list `uchar ushort vertex_index`, the following could be used:

    (load-ply-vao "example.ply" vertex: `((,vertex-location x y z) 
                                          (,color-location r g b))
                                face: vertex_index)

    [procedure] (type->gl-type TYPE)

Converts the keyword `TYPE` into a OpenGL type enum value. Accepted types (grouped by synonyms) are: 

- `char:` `int8:` `byte:`
- `uchar:` `uint8:` `unsigned-byte:`
- `short:` `int16:`
- `ushort:` `uint16:` `unsigned-short:`
- `int:` `int32:` `integer:` `integer32:`
- `uint:` `uint32:` `unsigned-int:` `unsigned-int32:` `unsigned-integer:` `unsigned-integer32:`
- `float:` `float32:`
- `double:` `float64:`

#### Vectors (srfi-4)
gl-utils reexports a version of [srfi-4](http://api.call-cc.org/doc/srfi-4) that gives preference to vectors being created in non-garbage collected memory. This is useful for use with OpenGL, since it is often desirable to pass vectors to OpenGL that will remain in one place. All srfi-4 functions not mentioned below are reexported without changes.

The `NNNvector` and `list->NNNvector` constructors have been modified so that they return vectors in non-garbage collected memory.

The `make-NNNvector` constructors act as their srfi-4 counterparts, except they now return vectors in non-garbage collected memory by default.

Additionally, the following non-srfi-4 procedures are exported:

    [procedure] (->pointer VECTOR)

Returns the pointer to a srfi-4 vector or blob.

    [procedure] (size VECTOR)

Returns the size, in bytes, of a srfi-4 vector or blob.

## Example
This example depends on the [glfw3](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/glfw3) egg for window and context creation, and the [gl-math](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/gl-math) egg for matrix math.
