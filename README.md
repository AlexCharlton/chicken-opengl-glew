# opengl-glew Chicken Scheme bindings

Bindings to OpenGL with GLEW extension loading.

Chicken's other [opengl](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/opengl) bindings are based on the old fixed function pipeline OpenGL. These bindings generated by [bind](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/bind) with the OpenGL [core header file](http://www.opengl.org/registry/api/GL/glcorearb.h). Additionally, bindings to [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) are provided for extension management.

## Requirements
- Make
- Bind

## Documentation
All functions and constants from the OpenGL [core header file](http://www.opengl.org/registry/api/GL/glcorearb.h) are exported. Scheme style names are provided (underscores and camelCase replaced with hyphens), the `gl` prefix is removed from names, `is` functions are given question marks, and constants are bookended by `+`s (e.g. `tex-image2d`, `enabled?`, `+arb-viewport-array+`).

### GLEW functions
#### init
    (init)

Required to initialize GLEW/OpenGL. An OpenGL context must be created before this is called.

#### supported?
    (supported? EXTENSION-NAME)

Query whether the OpenGL extension, given as a string, is supported.

### GL helper functions
#### make-shader
    (make-shader TYPE SOURCE)

Creates and compiles a shader object given the shader's type (e.g. `+vertex-shader+`, `+geometry-shader+`, `+fragment-shader`), and a string containing the GLSL source. Returns an integer representing the ID of the shader.

#### make-program
    (make-program SHADER-LIST)

Creates and links a program object, given a list of shader objects (i.e. the integers returned by `make-shader`. Returns an integer representing the ID of the program.



## Example
This example depends on the [glfw3](http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/4/glfw3) egg for window and context creation.

``` Scheme
(import chicken scheme)
(use (prefix glfw3 glfw:) (prefix opengl-glew gl:))

(define *vertex* 
#<<END
#version 330
in vec2 vertex;
in vec3 color;
out vec3 c;
uniform mat4 viewMatrix;

void main(){
   gl_Position = (viewMatrix * vec4(vertex, 0.0, 1.0));
   c = color;
}
END
)

(define *fragment*
#<<END
#version 330
in vec3 c;
out vec4 fragColor;
void main(){
  fragColor = vec4(c, 1.0);
}
END
)

(glfw:with-window (640 480 "Example" resizable: #f)
  (print (gl:supported? "GL_ARB_framebuffer_object"))

  (set! *vertex* (gl:make-shader gl:+vertex-shader+ *vertex*))
  (set! *fragment* (gl:make-shader gl:+fragment-shader+ *fragment*))

  ;;If this is not zero, then everything is working:
  (print (gl:make-program (list *vertex* *fragment*))))
```
